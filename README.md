# Agentic-onto

# Project Documentation: Agentic AI Healthcare App

## Quick Start for Beginners

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed

### Prepare an Empty Directory
- Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `Agentic-onto`).
- **Important:** The folder must be completely empty before you initialize Nx.
  - If you cloned from GitHub, temporarily move or back up `.git` and `README.md` before proceeding.

### Initialize the Nx Workspace
Open a terminal in your empty project folder and run:
```sh
npx create-nx-workspace@latest .
```
- When prompted for the stack, select: **None**
- When prompted for Prettier, select: **Yes**
- When prompted for CI, select: **GitHub Actions** (or your preference)
- Nx Cloud can be enabled (recommended for caching and CI)

### Restore Git and README (if needed)
- If you backed up `.git` and/or `README.md`, move them back into your project folder after Nx initialization.
- If starting fresh, you can initialize a new Git repo with:
  ```sh
  git init
  git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
  ```

## Overview
This project is the foundation for a cross-platform mobile application focused on agentic AI in the healthcare domain. The architecture is designed to support modular, scalable development using modern best practices.

## Current Workspace Structure
- `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`: Configuration files for code style and git.
- `.nx/`: Nx internal configuration and cache (including workspace-data for dependency graphs, caching, etc.).
- `.vscode/`: VS Code workspace settings.
- `node_modules/`: Installed dependencies.
- `nx.json`: Nx workspace configuration (base branch, input groups, etc.).
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies (Nx, placeholder dependency, private workspace).
- `package-lock.json`: Dependency lock file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## Nx Workspace
- The workspace is initialized with Nx, a monorepo tool for managing multiple apps and libraries.
- No apps or libraries have been generated yet. The workspace is ready for adding:
  - A React Native (Expo) app (frontend, TypeScript, monorepo/micro-frontend ready)
  - Backend microservices (Spring Boot for Java, or Node.js/TypeScript if needed)

## Micro-Frontend Approach (Mobile)
- While traditional micro-frontends are more common in web apps, this project adopts a modular architecture in React Native to simulate micro-frontend benefits:
  - The app will be structured into independent feature modules (each as a package or folder).
  - Nx monorepo enables teams to develop, test, and deploy features independently.
  - This modularity allows for scalable development, code sharing, and easier maintenance.
  - Each feature/module can be developed and integrated separately, similar to micro-frontend principles.
- **Note:** Expo (React Native) is not compatible with Webpack Module Federation or polyrepo architectures. Therefore, we are using a monorepo approach with Nx to achieve modularity and team scalability for mobile development.

## Planned Architecture
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo) in an Nx monorepo, supporting modular/micro-frontend-like structure.
- **Backend:** Microservices architecture, with Spring Boot (Java) for Neo4j integration and agentic AI logic.
- **Databases:**
  - Neo4j Aura for agentic AI, knowledge graph, and ontology-driven features.
  - Firebase for OLTP (transactional, real-time, and user-centric data).

## Next Steps
1. Install the Expo plugin for Nx:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev @nx/expo
   ```
2. Scaffold the Expo React Native app in the Nx workspace (TypeScript):
   ```sh
   npx nx generate @nx/expo:app agentic-ai-app
   ```
3. Set up backend folder structure for Spring Boot microservices.
4. Integrate Neo4j Aura and Firebase as per requirements.
5. Commit and push all changes to your GitHub repository to enable Nx Cloud and CI.
